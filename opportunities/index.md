Thank you for your interest in joining our research group. At this time, **we are not recruiting graduate students or postdoctoral researchers**. New opportunities depend on the availability of research funding, and this page will be **updated when positions become available**. The information below outlines the general requirements and expectations for prospective lab members.

<!-- Although I am not hiring any graduates and postdocs at the moment, I am actively seeking funding opportunities to support potential graduates and postdocs. 
If you want to write a proposal together please reach out to my email: [seogi.kang\@umanitoba.ca](mailto:seogi.kang@umanitoba.ca?subject=Test) -->

## General Requirements for Lab Members

Our lab works at the intersection of **geophysics, computation, and Earth systems**, with a strong focus on electromagnetic (EM) methods, inverse problems, **high-performance computing (HPC)**, and open science. While specific expectations may vary by position, the following provides a general overview.

### Academic Background

Prospective members typically have training in one or more of the following areas:

- Geophysics, geology, geoscience, or Earth science  
- Physics, applied mathematics, engineering, computer science, or a closely related field  

Applicants from interdisciplinary backgrounds are welcome, provided they demonstrate strong quantitative preparation and interest in subsurface imaging.

### Domain Knowledge (Preferred, Not Required)

Background or experience in one or more of the following domains is **preferred but not required**:

- **Mineral deposits and mineral exploration**, including massive sulfides, nickel–copper systems, or other critical mineral settings  
- **Groundwater and hydrogeology**, including aquifer systems, recharge processes, or water–rock interactions  

Applicants without prior domain-specific experience are strongly encouraged to apply if they have solid computational or quantitative skills and a willingness to learn new application areas.

### Technical Skills

Experience in some (not necessarily all) of the following is expected:

- A solid foundation in **mathematics and physics** relevant to geophysical methods  
- **Programming skills**, particularly in Python  
- Familiarity with numerical methods, signal processing, or inverse problems  
- Exposure to **high-performance computing**, such as:
  - Parallel computing (MPI, multiprocessing, or distributed workflows)  
  - Working on HPC clusters (job schedulers, batch scripts, resource allocation)  
  - Performance-aware computing for large-scale simulations and inversions  
- Experience working with geophysical data (e.g., EM, DC/IP, magnetics, gravity, or seismic) is an asset  

A willingness to develop HPC skills and to work with large, computationally intensive problems is essential.

### Research Mindset

Successful lab members are typically:

- Curious about how physical processes in the subsurface can be inferred from data  
- Comfortable working with complex, noisy, and large datasets  
- Interested in scaling algorithms from small test problems to **large, real-world systems**  
- Able to work independently while contributing effectively to collaborative projects  
- Interested in reproducible research, open-source software, and transparent workflows  

### Communication and Collaboration

Lab members are expected to:

- Communicate scientific ideas clearly in writing and presentations  
- Engage actively in group discussions and collaborative research  
- Contribute to an inclusive, respectful, and supportive research environment  

English proficiency sufficient for academic research and communication is required.

### Alignment with Lab Values

Our lab values:

- Scientific rigor and intellectual honesty  
- Open science and community contribution  
- Mentorship, inclusivity, and mutual respect  
- Responsible and ethical research practices  

Motivation, reliability, and genuine curiosity are valued as highly as prior experience.

### Notes

Specific position requirements (MSc, PhD, or postdoctoral) and funding details will be provided when opportunities become available.
